\section{Testing}

In Rust the majority of testing is done using the attribute \#[test] and the \textit{tests/} directory.

\subsection{Rust Testing mechanism}

To execute the test of the project use the command \textit{cargo test} this enables all the code flagged with \textit{cfg(test)}.
Then generates the \textbf{test harness}.

\subsubsection{Test Harness}

The test harness is created by the compiler and consists of a main function that invokes all the \#[test] functions of the code.

One can opt out from the harness to create the tests.

The integration test (i.e. the tests on the directory textit{tests/}) are build on a separate crate so they can only access the public interface of the code.

The \#[cfg(test)] allows to build code only to run the tests, also can be combined with other
