\section{Richness of Paths}

Brownian motion is \textbf{continuous everywhere} with probability one but is \textbf{not differentiable anywhere} with probability one.

\textbf{Donsker Thoerem} gives a formal transition from the random walk to the Brownian motion,
this gives us the idea that properties can be translated from one to the other.

Two \textbf{embedding theorems} consolidate the relations between the random walk and the Brownian motion by showing that we can find random walks inside the Brownian motion,
so the relation is bidirectional.
