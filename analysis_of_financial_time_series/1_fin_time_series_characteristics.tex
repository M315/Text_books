\section{Financial Time Series and Their Characteristics}

The studies of the financial time series is better done using their returns,
the \textit{Simple Returns} and the \textit{Continuous Compound Return / Log Returns} as they have more interesting statistical properties.
The relation between simple returns $R_t$ and the log-returns $r_t$ is given by,
\begin{equation*}
    r_t = \ln(1 + R_t)
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Distribution of returns}

Traditionally the normal distributions are used to model the returns,
but using tests of normally they show that the empirical data doesn't fit.
The test include to show that the empirical skewness or kurtosis should be normally distributed and reject the null hypothesis,
or the Jarque and Bera statistic test.
