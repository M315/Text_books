\section{Martingales: The Next Steps}

Define the \textbf{conditional expectation} for random variables and derive its basic properties like linearity, tower property, \dots

Define \textbf{uniform integrability} and use it to appreciate that the conditional expectation is a contraction.
And let us construct a link between convergence in probability an convergence in mean ($L^1$).

We now can define a \textbf{continuous time martingale} by a process $\{X_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ adapted to a \textit{filtration} $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$

\begin{equation}
    E(|X_t|) < \infty, \; \forall t \in [0, \infty),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    E(X_t | \mathcal{F}_s) = X_s, \; \forall 0 \leq s < t < \infty.
\end{equation}

We prove the \textbf{Doop's theorems} and the \textbf{martingale convergence theorems} for continuous martingales.

We prove the ruin theorems for the Brownian Motion using its representation as a martingale.
The results are the same as for the random walk, recall that we prove those using random walk properties and discrete martingales by separate.
